/**
 * rebuild-pack.mjs — the ONLY supported way to regenerate verify/.
 *
 * 19.8. Why this wrapper exists.
 *
 * `tools/build-offline-verify.mjs` stamps BUILD-INFO.txt with a generated
 * "N passed, 0 failed" line. That line is a CLAIM, and a build record that can
 * assert a green gate without ever having run one is worse than the hand-typed
 * counts it replaced: it would be machine-generated, machine-plausible, and
 * false. So the stamp is separated from the build:
 *
 *     1. run the full dev gate          -> if it is not green, STOP HERE
 *     2. build the offline pack         -> bundles + manifest
 *     3. run the offline pack           -> the zero-install gate, which is a
 *                                         different runner over different bytes
 *     4. only then stamp BUILD-INFO.txt
 *
 * A red gate at any step means nothing is stamped and the exit code is non-zero.
 * The counts can only ever describe a gate that actually passed.

//      has run. This is what breaks the deadlock in the other direction: the
//      pack's own freshness gate checks the counts, and would otherwise fail
//      against a record that had never been regenerated.
//   2. run the dev gate
//   3. run the zero-install offline gate
//   4. only then record the PASS claim, which is a fact about a gate RESULT
//
// A red gate at any step means the pass claim is not written and the exit code is
// non-zero, so the record can never assert green over a red gate.
