/**
 * probe/fedWired.test.ts — THE PRODUCTION FEDERATION PATH, PINNED (19.6.6).
 *
 * 19.6.4 shipped standing.ts, ledger.ts and regulatedPolicy.ts probed as
 * subsystems. 19.6.6 puts them ON the path the console actually runs:
 * src/engine/federation/live.ts is the seam — issue the grant once, spend it
 * per crossing, compare both stores into one common ledger, and keep the
 * regulated bench unrouted until a signed activation exists.
 *
 * The semantics pinned here are the shipped ones, stated plainly:
 *   • a standing grant never overrides earned pair standing — the tier is
 *     read from co-signed history (the mesh trust store, plus the federation
 *     ledger's jointly-held rows, plus the live grant itself, each counted
 *     as one trust unit through the mesh's own ladder);
 *   • a grant that does not cover a crossing escalates to a per-crossing
 *     human decision — escalation is designed behaviour, not an error;
 *   • the common ledger rides every outcome, refused rows included.
 *
 * Every test calls the same functions the UI calls. A localStorage shim
 * keeps the stores honest inside Node; the production modules read storage
 * only at call time, so the shim is in place before anything touches it.
