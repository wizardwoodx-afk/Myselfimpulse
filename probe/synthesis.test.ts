/**
 * probe/synthesis.test.ts — Captain synthesis (19.3.0 "Vanguard").
 *
 * Pins the capability the 19.2.0 review named as the remaining gap: the
 * Captain must REASON over its members' real outputs, not merely report
 * them — and it must do so the VH way: synthesis is the Captain's OWN
 * provider call with its OWN receipt, divergences are computed and surfaced,
 * a failed synthesis never fakes a combination, and a single-member run
 * never claims to synthesize.
