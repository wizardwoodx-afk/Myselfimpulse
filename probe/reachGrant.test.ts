/**
 * probe/reachGrant.test.ts — the narrowing decision for a cross-owner delegation.
 *
 * The cross-selfimpulse ladder already asks both humans before a risky delegation
 * runs, and a2aBridge already executes an accepted one and seals it. What this
 * suite pins is the decision BETWEEN those two facts: a delegation arrives
 * naming what it would like to do, and the selfimpulse returns the intersection of
 * that ask with what it will lend this counterparty at this standing — with
 * every withheld capability withheld out loud, by rule.
 *
 *   §1 standing is read from SelfImpulseMesh, never asserted by the caller
 *   §2 the lending table: what each standing actually receives
 *   §3 human-first is enforced at runtime; the irreversible set cannot be relaxed
 *   §4 approvals are capability-bound, attributable and expiring
 *   §5 nothing is silently dropped — unknown asks are refused by name
 *   §6 the grant is an artefact: deterministic digest, no secrets, filed as-is
