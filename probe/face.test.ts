/**
 * FACE SYSTEM PROBE — 19.6.6 (the naming redesign).
 *
 * Pins the avatar swap mechanically:
 *   1. the Generalist's face is a pure function of the owner-chosen name
 *      (a declared dependency): same name → same SVG, different name → different SVG;
 *   2. the mood→expression map is COMPLETE over the GeneralistMood contract —
 *      a mood without a face is a failure, not a silent blank;
 *   3. the name is stored locally under one key, defaulted once;
 *   4. specialists ride deterministic marks keyed by id;
 *   5. the old OSS engine is GONE: no vendored oneworks directory, no import,
 *      no mention anywhere in src/ — the product carries no borrowed faces;
 *   6. the console is wired: App routes the door to NextConsole, the new
 *      design sheet ships, and Tailwind v4 is a real build input.
