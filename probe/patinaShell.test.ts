/**
 * Shell probe â€” the one shell (src/ui/Shell.tsx).
 *
 * History: this suite pinned the Patina shell (selfimpulse.tsx + five views), then the
 * 19.6.6 Federation Console. Both are retired. The 19.7.12 redesign shipped ONE
 * shell and ONE store (src/ui/store.ts) that is the only path to the engine;
 * 19.7.13 added the sixth door (Docs). The live door set is Steward Â· Work Â·
 * Receipts Â· Docs Â· Memory Â· Settings.
 * The guarantees are the same ones the older shells were held to: the app
 * mounts exactly this shell, the screens never bypass the store to reach the
 * engine, every primary action is wired, and the human gate cannot be skipped.
