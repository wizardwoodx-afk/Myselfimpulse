/**
 * probe/navAlign.test.ts â€” shell alignment probe (the one shell, src/ui/Shell.tsx).
 *
 * The 19.7.12 redesign replaced the 19.6.6 console with one quiet shell; 19.7.13
 * added the sixth door, and the Specialists door the seventh â€” the generalist domain
 * surface, with the Indian-finance pack hosted as one of its nine domains, and the
 * Federation door the eighth â€” the A2A mounting surface, which the bundling of an
 * A2A host had made real in the architecture but invisible in the product. The live
 * door set is eight â€” Steward Â· Work Â· Specialists Â· Federation Â· Receipts Â· Docs Â·
 * Memory Â· Settings â€” with one store and one composer.
 * This suite pins the structure mechanically:
 *  - App renders the shell and nothing else
 *  - the sidebar carries exactly the eight doors + status + owner â€” every one wired
 *  - the composer is the single command surface (Enter sends through the store)
 *  - the human gate is a card with approve/refuse, never a silent skip
 *  - the crew is internal: Work shows AGENT nn, never a specialist name
