/**
 * probe/workspace.test.ts — 11WORKSPACE and the org.
 *
 * Pins: 30 desks × Adept+HR = 60 domain specialists; every established
 * worker maps to a desk; leads are NOT in the routed catalog; Captain
 * musters the office from the request alone (no picker); a compound
 * app+docs+mail ask opens ≥3 desks; the floor is workers only, ≤25,
 * and every floor id exists in the registry.
 *
 * THE COMPANY CHAIN (USER ⇄ Captain ⇄ Consul ⇄ Adept ⇄ sub-agents): the
 * no-skip law (src/engine/chain.ts), its enforcement on the real desks
 * (every desk resolves to exactly one Consul; seating a desk with none is a
 * LayerSkipError), the titles' single source of truth, and a source scan that
 * no surface still carries a retired layer title.
