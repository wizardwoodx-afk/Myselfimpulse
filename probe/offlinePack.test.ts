/**
 * VH probe suite #40 — the offline verification pack (V11.7.1).
 *
 * The 11.7.0 review's one open caveat: "I am not independently certifying the claimed
 * 39/39 runtime test result" — the zip ships no node_modules and its environment could
 * not `npm ci` offline. V11.7.1 closes that with verify/: every probe suite (except this
 * one) pre-bundled into a self-contained .mjs, plus a zero-dependency runner
 * (verify/run.mjs), so anyone with Node reproduces the full gate with zero install.
 *
 * This suite is the pack's FRESHNESS GATE. It runs only under `npm test` (it needs the
 * dev toolchain — esbuild — which is exactly why it is not packed) and proves:
 *   1. COVERAGE — the pack contains exactly the other probe suites, nothing more or
 *      less, decided by the same shared module both runners use (tools/probe-list.mjs).
 *   2. FRESHNESS / ANTI-FABRICATION — a fresh rebuild of every bundle is BYTE-IDENTICAL
 *      to the committed verify/suites/*.mjs, and verify/MANIFEST.json's sha256s match
 *      the files on disk. A stale or hand-edited pack fails here, loudly.
 *   3. EXECUTABILITY — `node verify/run.mjs` actually runs, offline-style, and reports
 *      N/N passed.
 *
 * Run like every suite (see the command at the top of probe/harnesses.test.ts):
 *   esbuild probe/offlinePack.test.ts --bundle --platform=node --format=esm \
 *     --define:SI_ROOT='"$(pwd)"' --outfile=/tmp/op.mjs --log-level=error && node /tmp/op.mjs

/* ── 0. the pack is a BUILD ARTIFACT, and a source tree may need not to carry it ─
 *
 * verify/suites/ ships prebuilt esbuild bundles for every suite except this one, so a
 * fresh checkout can run the whole gate with zero node_modules: node verify/run.mjs.
 *
 * But because it is also 85 MB of generated output, an absence is a legitimate state,
 * not a broken one: a source-only archive, a clean extract from a delivery zip, a
 * machine that needed the space back. Everything below — coverage against the suite
 * list, freshness against a fresh rebuild, MANIFEST hashes, the recorded counts, the
 * zero-install run itself — is a fact ABOUT the pack. With no pack there is nothing
 * here to verify, and the one thing this suite may never do is call an unrun check a
 * pass. So it says what happened, in words, names the single command that fixes it,
 * and declares SKIPPED; the dev runner counts that apart from both passed and failed.
