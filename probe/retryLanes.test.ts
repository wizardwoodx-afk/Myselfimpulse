/**
 * probe/retryLanes.test.ts — a wait is not a failure. The lift from Paperclip's
 * `execution-recovery-attempt.ts` and `approved-execution-wait.ts` (MIT,
 * Copyright (c) 2025 Paperclip AI; licence at `LICENSES/paperclip-MIT.txt`).
 *
 * THE PROPERTY UNDER TEST IS ONE SENTENCE: the number that decides whether a run
 * gets to keep trying must move only when something actually went wrong.
 *
 * SelfImpulse's defect was not a missing counter, it was a counter that could not
 * tell three different things apart — a provider that failed, a wave that
 * settled, and a person who had not answered the gate yet. The third is the one
 * that hurt: a crew parked at the gate was a crew whose steps were AGING, so
 * `timeoutLoop`, `stall` and the mission's 30-minute ceiling all charged the run
 * for the operator's reading speed. `failureDetection.ts` still measures the
 * clock; what this module changes is that the clock is no longer the only number
 * a resuming run reads.
 *
 * §1–§6 are the pure contract and are exercised directly. §7 pins the wiring in
 * the two files that own the durable chain, because a correct module with no
 * caller is exactly the thing this repository has been audited for before; those
 * assertions read the source rather than pretending to drive a live resume.
