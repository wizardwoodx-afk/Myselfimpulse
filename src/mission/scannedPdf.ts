/**
 * SelfImpulse §13 — the SCANNED-DOCUMENT reader: a page with no text layer, read on this
 * machine.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `documentParsers.parsePdf` reads a PDF's text layer and, finding none,
 * used to refuse with "this PDF has no text layer — it is a scan or an image". That refusal
 * was honest but it was also a dead end: a scanned invoice, a photographed contract or a
 * deck exported as images could not enter the Docs door at all. This module closes that
 * dead end without opening a new one, by composing two narrow pieces that are already
 * proven separately:
 *
 *   `pdfRender.readPdf`  — rasterises the pages that carry no text (pdf.js is the reader
 *                          for text and stays the reader for text; it cannot rasterise in
 *                          Node without a native canvas, which is why a second, pure-WASM
 *                          renderer does this one job).
 *   `ocr.readImages`     — recognises those page images locally.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not call a vision model, it does not call a
 * provider, and it does not fetch language data. The Docs door is mechanical: bytes in,
 * markdown out, and the SAME `proposeKnowledgeSkill` a pasted note walks decides the rest.
 *
 * WHY THE OUTPUT IS MARKDOWN WITH HEADINGS. `proposeKnowledgeSkill` refuses anything with no
 * extractable structure (guardline G2), and a scan yields flat prose — so a reader that
 * returned the recognised text as-is would hand the Docs door a document that walks through
 * the door and is then refused by the next gate, for a reason that has nothing to do with
 * the document. A scan has exactly one structural fact available and it is a true one: which
 * page each line came from. So every page becomes a `##` heading. That is enough for
 * `extractStructure` to read, and it is not invented — the heading states a fact about the
 * file, not a guess about its content.
 *
 * ── THE PREFLIGHT, AND THE BUG THAT TAUGHT IT ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This module checks that the reader's language data is present BEFORE it starts, so a
 * missing file is a clear refusal rather than an engine-internal error twenty pages in. That
 * check used to ask `node:fs`. In a browser there is no `node:fs`, so it answered "absent"
 * for data that was in fact sitting in the build output — every scanned PDF refused with
 * "OCR unavailable", on the one platform where the feature was meant to be the default. The
 * check was correct about the world it could see and wrong about the world it was in.
 *
 * So the check now asks whichever question fits the runtime it is actually running in:
 * a filesystem where there is one, and the ASSET URL where there is not. A same-origin
 * request to the app's own bundle is not egress — it never leaves the machine — and it is
 * the only honest way to ask "is the bundled asset there" from inside a webview. When the
 * answer cannot be determined at all, the read PROCEEDS rather than refusing: inventing a
 * failure because a precondition could not be verified would be the same bug wearing the
 * opposite coat.
 *
 * EGRESS: none. The language data is required to be present on this machine, a missing file
 * is a refusal in words, and the only request this module can make is to its own origin.
