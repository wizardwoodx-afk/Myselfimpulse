/**
 * selfimpulseTeams.ts — the major upgrade: persistent named agent teams over A2A v1.0,
 * with the human in the loop on BOTH sides.
 *
 * WHAT THIS BUILDS (and why each rule exists)
 *   • TEAMMATES — persistent, named agents with a name, a title and a
 *     DESCRIPTION (the pattern: the description is what delegation reads). Descriptions are GuardRail-sanitized and injection-scanned at
 *     creation time: a poisoned description is persistent injection.
 *   • DELEGATION ROUTING — a task is matched against teammate descriptions
 *     by token overlap. When nothing matches well the router REFUSES in
 *     words; it never invents a worker (§38 doctrine: no fake capability).
 *   • SELFIMPULSE LINKS — USER 1's selfimpulse connects to USER 2's selfimpulse through an
 *     A2A v1.0 AgentCard. A signed card is verified against the issuer's
 *     public JWK before the link is accepted; an unverified link refuses to
 *     carry delegations. Identity comes from the crossSelfImpulse seam — the
 *     same ECDSA P-256 keypair that anchors receipts between machines.
 *   • CROSS-USER DELEGATION — `delegateAcrossSelfImpulses` runs the whole flow:
 *       GuardRail on the task (deny on injection findings — the inter-agent
 *       channel must stay clean) → sender-side gate → signed delegation
 *       packet → receiver-side GuardRail re-scan → receiver-side gate →
 *       matched receiver teammate executes → dual tamper-evident digests.
 *   • THE AUTONOMY LADDER — the human stays in the loop proportionally:
 *       tier "safe"  (read-only collaboration) → autonomous on both sides;
 *       tier "risky" (writes, execution, spend) → BOTH humans must approve,
 *       either human can deny, and a denial executes nothing.
 *     Decisions apply ONCE (replay-safe), expire with the packet TTL, and
 *     every outcome — approval, denial, refusal — lands in both ledgers.
 *     The audit trail is never optional.
 *
 * HONESTY: this module proves the mechanism locally (two selfimpulse identities
 * in one process — the same discipline as the drill). Real network carriage
 * rides the SelfImpulse Protocol's device-to-device substrate; nothing here
 * phones home, and nothing claims a remote execution it cannot show.

   FEDERATION DEPTH — how far ONE delegation chain may travel

   THE THREAT MODEL, because the obvious fix does not work.

   A hop counter carried in the packet is useless as a bound on its own: the
   sender is the party being bounded, so it declares `hop: 1` on every round and
   the field costs nothing to forge. `capability.delegationDepth === 0` does not
   help either — that constrains what a CAPABILITY may authorise, on the mint
   path, and a delegation packet is not a capability. The replay registries cannot
   help: they dedupe by packet id, and `secureId("d")` mints a fresh id on every
   call, so every round of a loop arrives as a packet nobody has seen.

   So the only number a receiver can trust is the one it counts ITSELF:

       observedHop = (hops this receiver already executed for this chain) + 1

   The claim is still carried, and it is still inside `packetDigest`, so it cannot
   be edited in flight. But it is treated as ATTACKER INPUT: checked for
   well-formedness, refused when malformed, and — this is the property that makes
   it safe — it can only ever refuse EARLIER than the observed count would. A
   forged `hop: 1` buys a peer nothing, because the observed counter is what gets
   compared against the limit. An ABSENT claim is read as "the first hop of a new
   chain", which is both the only true reading and worth exactly one hop; a
   MALFORMED claim — wrong type, fractional, below 1, over-long id, non-string
   path entry — is refused outright rather than repaired.

   REAL-WIRE DELEGATION — A2A v1.0 transport (Warrant-Teams)

   delegateAcrossSelfImpulses above is the in-process flow (both teams in one
   runtime). This seam carries the SAME governance ladder over the released
   A2A 1.0.0 wire:

     sender teammate → routing → GuardRail → sender gate → packet digest
        → message/send (JSON-RPC) → remote selfimpulse's A2A server
        → receiver GuardRail re-scan → receiver routing → receiver gate
        → execution → receiver digest → response → sender verifies digests

   The receiving selfimpulse mounts `makeDelegationHandler` as the onMessage
   handler of its createA2AServer() — its own human gate, its own routing,
   its own governance. Nothing about the ladder is weakened for transport:
   unverified cards carry nothing, injection findings hard-refuse on BOTH
   sides, dual digests make the artifact tamper-evident, and every event is
   published to the inter-agent bus for the UI.
