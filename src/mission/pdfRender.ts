/**
 * SelfImpulse — the PDF page reader that can see.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `documentParsers.ts` refuses any PDF with no text layer, in these
 * words: "this PDF has no text layer — it is a scan or an image. Reading it would need
 * OCR, which this version does not do." That refusal is honest, and it is also the
 * single largest hole in the Docs door: a scanned contract, a photographed invoice and
 * a stamped circular are the documents a real operator most often has, and every one of
 * them was refused.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED. The engine underneath the text reader already rasterises pages — it has
 * to, to draw them. That capability was simply not exposed. This module exposes it: a
 * page that carries no text can now be RENDERED, and a rendered page is an image, and an
 * image is something the engine can already hand to a vision-capable provider or to a
 * local OCR step. Nothing new is inferred; a door that was closed is opened.
 *
 * THE DIVISION IS DELIBERATE, AND IT IS THE SAME ONE THE DOCS DOOR ALREADY KEEPS.
 *   • This module READS and RENDERS. It does not call a model, and it does not decide.
 *   • What happens to a rendered image — vision pass, OCR, or a refusal in words — is
 *     the caller's decision, made at the gate, where every other decision is made.
 *   • A page that renders but yields no text is NOT a failure here. It is a page with an
 *     image and no text, reported as exactly that. The judgement belongs downstream.
 *
 * AUTHORITY + PROVENANCE. This module holds none. It cannot execute, fetch, install or
 * mutating anything. It takes bytes and returns bytes. Every cap below is a refusal in
 * words (the house rule: an unreadable file is never an empty document), and the caller
 * receipts the outcome the same way `fileIngest` already does.
 *
 * DETERMINISM. Same bytes, same options, same result — pages are read in order, nothing
 * consults the clock for its answer (the deadline only ever produces a refusal), and no
 * randomness or network is involved. The probe pins byte-identical repeat runs, because
 * a reader whose output drifts cannot be hashed into a receipt.
 *
 * DEPENDENCY, NAMED PLAINLY. One: `clawpdf` (MIT, zero transitive dependencies, PDFium
 * as WASM — the same engine Chrome renders PDFs with). It downloads nothing at runtime
 * and phones home to nothing. Its licence notice belongs in LICENSES/ beside the pdfjs,
 * mammoth and jszip notices already there.
