/**
 * SelfImpulse — the local OCR reader.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `documentParsers.ts` refuses any PDF with no text layer: "this PDF
 * has no text layer — it is a scan or an image. Reading it would need OCR, which this
 * version does not do." That refusal was honest and it was also the largest hole in the
 * Docs door. A scanned contract, a photographed invoice and a stamped circular are the
 * documents an operator most often has, and every one of them was refused.
 *
 * WHY OCR AND NOT A VISION MODEL. The Docs door is deliberately MECHANICAL: it calls
 * `proposeKnowledgeSkill` without a direct provider call, because local execution is a
 * desktop-host capability and the document is not sent anywhere to be understood. A
 * vision pass would break that posture — it needs a provider, it sends the page off the
 * machine, and it makes the door depend on configuration it currently does not need.
 * OCR keeps the door exactly as mechanical as it was. Nothing leaves the machine. No
 * provider is consulted. The same `proposeKnowledgeSkill` the paste box reaches still
 * receives the text, so there is no second pipeline to drift out of step.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THAT MAKES THIS ON-DEVICE, AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL. Tesseract.js fetches
 * its language data over the network by default. This module NEVER does. A caller must
 * supply a local directory holding the trained data; if the data for the requested
 * language is not there, this module REFUSES IN WORDS and names the remedy. It does not
 * fall back to a CDN, it does not try a different language, and it does not return
 * partial text. A reader that silently reaches the internet would make the product's
 * on-device promise false, and the egress guards would be right to block it.
 *
 * AUTHORITY + PROVENANCE. This module holds none. It reads bytes and returns text; it
 * cannot execute, fetch, install or mutate anything. Every cap below is a refusal in
 * words (the house rule: an unreadable file is never an empty document), and the caller
 * receipts the outcome the way `fileIngest` already does.
 *
 * DETERMINISM. OCR is a neural recogniser, so "byte-identical on every machine" is not a
 * promise this module can honestly make and it does not make it. What it does guarantee,
 * and what the probe pins, is: the same engine, same input and same options produce the
 * same text and the same confidence on repeated runs; the decision of WHETHER to read is
 * deterministic; and the module never throws.
 *
 * DEPENDENCY, NAMED PLAINLY. One: `tesseract.js` (Apache-2.0, WASM, CPU-only, no GPU).
 * Its language data is NOT bundled — it is provisioned by the caller, deliberately.
 * Pair it with `pdfRender` for the full chain: a PDF page with no text layer is rendered
 * to a PNG, and that PNG is read here.
