/**
 * SelfImpulse §13 — the format readers. Each one turns a binary document into
 * MARKDOWN WITH REAL HEADINGS, and that shape is the whole design.
 *
 * WHY MARKDOWN AND NOT PLAIN TEXT: the Docs door already owns the judgement
 * about what counts as knowledge. `knowledgeSkills.extractStructure` reads
 * headings, bullets and decision rules out of text, and `proposeKnowledgeSkill`
 * REFUSES anything with no extractable structure (guardline G2). If these
 * parsers emitted flat prose, every PDF and deck would either fail that gate
 * spuriously — or, worse, be waved through by a second, softer gate built just
 * for files. There is no second gate. A .docx's heading levels become `##`, a
 * spreadsheet's sheet names and header row become `##` and `-`, a deck becomes
 * one `##` per slide, and from there the document walks the SAME path a pasted
 * note walks: distil → propose → a human decides. The structural rule the owner
 * asked to preserve is preserved by construction, not by a promise.
 *
 * WHAT THESE DO NOT DO: they do not decide whether a document is worth
 * approving, and they do not cap bytes (see archiveScan.ts — that is the gate,
 * this is the reader). They report two kinds of fact and nothing else: the text
 * they found, or a refusal in words. An unreadable file is never an empty
 * success — that is the whole of F17's lesson applied to ingestion.
 *
 * EGRESS: none, in any direction. Every function here is pure bytes-in,
 * text-out; nothing fetches, nothing loads a remote font, dictionary or
 * stylesheet. pdf.js is the one library with a habit of fetching auxiliary
 * data, so `useSystemFonts`/no `cMapUrl`/no `standardFontDataUrl` is a
 * deliberate choice and probe/fileIngest.test.ts §egress pins that no module
 * in this path can call out.

  /* ── THE IMAGE PATH, AND WHY IT IS NO LONGER ALL-OR-NOTHING ────────────────
   *
   * This used to be a single branch: if the document produced NO markdown at all, hand the
   * whole thing to the image reader; otherwise use the text and never look at the images.
   * That reads as reasonable and it silently loses pages. A PDF with a typed cover sheet, a
   * scanned body and a typed appendix produced pages 1 and 3 as text — so `markdown` was
   * non-empty, the image reader was never called, and PAGE 2 SIMPLY WAS NOT THERE. No
   * mention, no note, no refusal: a document that reads as complete and is not. It is the
   * same class of lie as an empty acceptance, and the codebase refuses that everywhere else.
   *
   * So the decision is per PAGE, not per document. Pages with text keep their text; pages
   * without it are given to the image reader; the results are spliced back in page order.
   * `readScannedPdf` renders exactly the pages whose text is absent, so no page that already
   * has a text layer is ever rasterised and re-recognised — the cheap lossless path stays
   * the path for pages that have one.
   *
   * The two outcomes are deliberately different in kind:
   *   • the whole document has no text  → if it cannot be read, REFUSE it. A file that is
   *     entirely unreadable is not a document this door can propose, and approving it as an
   *     empty one is exactly the failure this reading of the code exists to prevent.
   *   • SOME pages have no text         → if they cannot be read, NAME the gap and carry on.
   *     Refusing a mostly-legible contract because one page is a scan would be worse than
   *     the bug being fixed. Naming the page is what the container path already does for a
   *     member it would not read: "## Member: x — (refused: …)". Same rule, same shape. */
