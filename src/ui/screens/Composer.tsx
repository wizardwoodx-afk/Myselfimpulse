/** The share row is GONE, and this comment is the record of why.
 *
 * It used to render five chips — PDF · DOCX · XLSX · PPTX · ZIP — beside the
 * paperclip, each with a glyph and a tooltip. The reasoning at the time was
 * that the door should "say what it accepts without a paragraph". Measured
 * against the actual UI, that was wrong on three counts:
 *
 *   1. THEY WERE NOT CONTROLS. They were `<span>`s. They looked like buttons,
 *      they sat in a button row, and clicking one did nothing at all. A chip
 *      that reads as clickable and is not is worse than no chip.
 *   2. THEY STATED A LIMIT THAT WAS NEVER THERE. The hidden file input has no
 *      `accept` attribute, so the engine's own reader decides — it handles far
 *      more than these five. Five chips told the user "these five only", which
 *      is a false promise about the product's capability.
 *   3. THEY CROWDED THE ONE CONTROL THAT MATTERED. The bar held SEVEN
 *      affordances (five chips, a paperclip, a folder) for one action. The
 *      paperclip is the action; the rest was decoration competing with it.
 *
 * The information is not lost, it is MOVED: the paperclip's `title` now carries
 * the formats, so the capability is discoverable on hover without spending
 * permanent horizontal space on it. This is the ordinary pattern — one
 * attachment button, its accepted types in its tooltip. */
