 * THE WORD SELFIMPULSE SPEAKS WHILE A RUN IS IN FLIGHT.
 *
 * A spinner reports that something is busy. It does not report what, and here the
 * what is the whole product: the Captain reads the request, lays out the work the
 * desks will do, counts what it will cost, and puts the result in front of a human
 * who has not said yes yet. These words name that posture.
 *
 * They are deliberately not the stock set. Thinking / Analyzing / Processing /
 * Loading describe a machine with a queue, and this app has a gate instead of one.
 * Two other verbs are missing on purpose — "deciding" and "confirming" — because
 * those belong to the owner, and the gate is exactly where they get used. Nothing
 * here claims a decision the human has not made.
 *
 * Each entry is also something the engine genuinely does, not a mood: it measures
 * cost against the FinOps ledger, it plans before it executes (a run with no
 * provider returns a plan and says so), and it frames the `ask` object that
 * reaches the gate card.
