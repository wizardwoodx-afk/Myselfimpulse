/**
 * SelfImpulse — the CONSUL layer (19.0.0 as AgentLead; renamed Captain in
 * 19.1.0 "Shipyard"; renamed Consul in the structure revision). The org
 * chain is strict and never skips a rung (the law lives in ./chain):
 *
 *   USER ⇄ CAPTAIN (CEO — the only human-facing seat)
 *           ⇄ CONSUL (this file — one per domain; reports UP to the CEO,
 *                     never addresses the user, never commands the crew)
 *                     ⇄ ADEPT (desk lead) ⇄ SUB-AGENTS (the crew)
 *
 * Specialists within a domain are not a flat crowd: every domain has exactly
 * one Consul — a named oversight role that (a) plans domain work across its
 * members, (b) aggregates what actually happened, and (c) reports UP to the
 * Captain in a structured, honest report. The Consul never fabricates member
 * outcomes: its report is computed from the real pipeline results, and it is
 * part of the provenance-digested response. A Consul is an orchestrator over
 * states — like the goal engine, it calls no provider and invents nothing.
 *
 * Coverage is an invariant, not a hope: every specialist category — including
 * finance and silicon, whose desks field hundreds of sub-agents — has a Consul,
 * and every desk's category resolves to one (probe/workspace pins both). A
 * domain with no Consul would let the Captain brief an Adept directly.
 *
 * Ids keep the historical `captain.<domain>` prefix: stored receipts, synthesis
 * records and probes reference them, so the TITLE changed and the key did not.
