/**
 * FEDERATION · STANDING AUTHORITY — approve once, then run autonomously, with
 * the same evidence.
 *
 * THE ASK THIS MODULE ANSWERS. A crossing currently stops for a human decision
 * on EACH side, EVERY time. That is correct for the first crossing and for
 * anything unusual, and it is untenable for the tenth crossing of the same kind
 * in the same day — which is the case that actually exists in a working pair of
 * agents. The request was: let both owners approve ONCE, then let the pair work
 * autonomously, with the same security.
 *
 * WHAT IS REMOVED, EXACTLY. The human is removed from the loop. The EVIDENCE is
 * not. Every crossing still:
 *   • carries its own envelope — CSPRNG id, one nonce per side, recomputed
 *     digest, untouched by this module;
 *   • is authorised individually under the grant, by an acknowledgement bound to
 *     THIS envelope digest and THIS side's nonce;
 *   • is single-use, and lands in the same ledger and receipt path as a
 *     per-crossing decision;
 *   • is refused the moment the grant's bounds are exceeded.
 *
 * WHAT THE BOUNDS ARE — because "autonomous" without bounds is just unlogged
 * hope. A grant that cannot be exhausted, overrun in rate, or expired is not a
 * grant:
 *
 *   capabilities    enumerated, from the selfimpulse's own delegation vocabulary —
 *                   never `*`; a grant naming every capability is a blank cheque
 *   maxCrossings    a total budget; spent grants stop, they do not renew
 *   windowMs/windowMax  a rate bound, so a compromised peer cannot drain the
 *                   budget in a burst
 *   expiresAt       a date the humans must look again
 *   onOutOfScope    always "escalate" — anything outside the grant returns to a
 *                   per-crossing human decision (approval.ts), never proceeds
 *                   on standing authority by inference
 *   two signatures  BOTH owners' authority keys sign the identical canonical
 *                   body; one side cannot grant itself authority over a pair
 *
 * WHAT A RECEIPT MAY SAY, AND MAY NOT. With per-crossing approvals the honest
 * sentence was "the owner's authority key approved this crossing, naming the
 * human who authorised it." Under standing authority that sentence would be a
 * lie about *this* crossing, so the acknowledgement prints something narrower —
 * and, beside it, what is missing:
 *
 *   ATTESTED      the owner's authority key authorised this crossing in
 *                 advance, under a standing grant naming the human who set its
 *                 scope and bounds
 *   NOT ATTESTED  that a human reviewed this specific crossing — the grant was
 *                 approved once, and its bounds are what stand in for a
 *                 per-crossing decision
 *
 * That pair of sentences is the whole point of the module: autonomy that does
 * not quietly upgrade itself into human review in the record.
 *
 * It reuses, deliberately, the selfimpulse's own keypair (`authorityWeb`), the
 * delegation vocabulary from `reach/delegationGrant`, and the receipt discipline
 * of `federation/approval.ts` — a filed acknowledgement looks like a filed
 * approval, so one reader can check both. WebCrypto only, no node builtins.
