/**
 * FEDERATION · CROSSING — a cross-owner delegation that both humans decided.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG BEFORE. The alpha's `respondToCrossing()` decided the
 * responder's first crossing by looking at history:
 *
 *     if (!hasCrossedBefore(pair)) { ...refuse... }
 *     // and a ledger row `{ kind: "success", note: "a person at selfimpulse-b
 *     // walked this pair through once already" }` made hasCrossedBefore true
 *
 * So the second side trusted a RECORD as if it were a DECISION. History can
 * show what happened; it cannot show that the human who owns this machine
 * agreed to *this* crossing. This module requires a signed approval from each
 * side, bound to the exact envelope, before anything crosses — and a prior
 * success row does not substitute for one, which is pinned by probe.
 *
 * THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS IS THE SECURITY PROPERTY:
 *
 *   1. the envelope is minted FIRST (CSPRNG id + nonce per side) and digested
 *   2. each SIDE's approval is verified AGAINST THAT DIGEST, so a decision
 *      taken for some other crossing cannot be re-aimed at this one
 *
 * WHO SIGNS, PRECISELY. Each side's approval is signed by that selfimpulse's OWNER
 * AUTHORITY KEY and names the human it acts on behalf of. The crossing's
 * receipts therefore attest: *the owner-controlled key of each selfimpulse approved,
 * naming who authorised it* — and do NOT attest that the named human
 * authenticated with a separate credential. Both sentences travel with every
 * filed approval (`approvalRecord().attests` / `.notAttested`), so a reader is
 * never left to infer the stronger claim.
 *   3. the capability is narrowed separately on each side, by that selfimpulse's
 *      own policy and that pair's standing (SelfImpulseMesh, read live)
 *   4. a crossing happens only if BOTH sides' grants allow it AND both
 *      approvals verified; otherwise the refusal names the side and the rule
 *
 * DISTRIBUTED EVIDENCE, LOCAL TRUST — and the runtime models it, it does not
 * just say it. Two agents each keep their own trust ledger
 * (`engine.mesh.trust.v1` on each machine). The evidence — envelopes, approvals,
 * receipts — is portable and verifiable by either party; the trust SCORE is
 * local observation and may legitimately differ. So this module takes a
 * standing reader PER SIDE (`standingInitiator` / `standingResponder`): the
 * initiator's grant is computed against the initiator's own local store and the
 * responder's grant against the responder's own local store, and the outcome
 * records which store each tier came from. When a caller has only one machine,
 * one reader serves both sides — and the receipt says `shared: true` rather
 * than pretending two stores agreed.
 *
 * This module reads standing, never writes it: pair trust moves only through
 * SelfImpulseMesh's own `recordJointOutcome`.
 *
 * SCOPE. This is the reference model of a crossing, run where both sides'
 * state can be verified together. In a two-machine deployment each selfimpulse
 * computes its own side's grant locally and exchanges the signed envelope,
 * approvals and receipt this module defines; nothing here claims to be the
 * wire between them.
