/**
 * SelfImpulse — THE COMPANY CHAIN. One place, no duplicates.
 *
 * The product is organised like a working team: five rungs and one law.
 *
 *   USER  ⇄  CAPTAIN  ⇄  CONSUL   ⇄  ADEPT      ⇄  CREW
 *   owner    the CEO     domain       desk's        the sub-agents
 *                        manager      team lead     that do the work
 *
 * THE LAW — no rung is ever skipped. A message moves exactly one rung up (a
 * report) or one rung down (a brief). So a Consul can never address the user
 * or a sub-agent, the Captain can never brief an Adept, and the user can never
 * reach the crew. Peers on one rung coordinate through the rung above them,
 * never sideways.
 *
 * This module is a LEAF (it imports nothing), so org / captains / workspace /
 * generalist and the UI all derive their wording AND their rule from it:
 *
 *   • TITLES is the single source of the layer names. Renaming a rung is a
 *     one-line change here; no surface hard-codes a title.
 *   • mayAddress / assertMayAddress / legalPath ARE the law — pure, testable.
 *   • workspace.ts refuses to seat a desk whose Consul is missing: an Adept
 *     with no Consul above it would make the Captain brief an Adept directly,
 *     which is a skipped rung. That refusal is a LayerSkipError, not a log line.
 *
 * What this module does NOT claim: it does not say an LLM message crossed each
 * rung on every run. It is the reporting structure the run is seated in, and
 * the rule any hop in that structure must obey.
