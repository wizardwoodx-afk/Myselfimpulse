   WebKitGTK / Tauri webviews on older Windows/macOS do not provide it. A single
   shim here keeps the Docs PDF path alive on those hosts instead of throwing
   "Promise.withResolvers is not a function". If the host already ships it,
   this is a no-op. Declared on `globalThis.Promise` with a type assertion

   would widen types elsewhere — a small augmentation here is safer. */
