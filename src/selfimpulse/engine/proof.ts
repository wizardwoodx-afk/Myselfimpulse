/**
 * §PROOF — cryptographically attestable work evidence (SelfImpulse 1.0).
 *
 * THE DIFFERENTIATOR. Every agent can *claim* a job happened. SelfImpulse issues
 * receipts instead: tamper-evident, signed, independently verifiable.
 * "Every job attested" — the claim is checkable by anyone, with zero SelfImpulse
 * state: re-canonicalize, re-hash the chain, re-check the seal.
 *
 * PROTOCOL — `si-proof-receipt/2`, the SelfImpulse proof standard (16.1.0):
 * the legacy wire ("mj-proof-receipt/1|2") still verifies — one open verifier covers all receipts):
 *   format   — "si-proof-receipt/2" (legacy "mj-proof-receipt/1|2" receipts still verify)
 *   header   — mission, team, started/finished, version (issuing product),
 *              edition, autonomyArms (empty for standalone SelfImpulse)
 *   events   — one per measured fact; each carries `prev` + `hash`,
 *              hash = SHA-256( canonical(prev ‖ event-without-hash) )
 *   seal     — HMAC-SHA-256 over the final chain hash with the shared
 *              verification secret (soft seal, externally re-computable)
 *   issuer   — Ed25519 signature over the final chain hash where the runtime
 *              can sign; null + an honest note when it cannot.
 *
 * VERIFICATION — `node tools/verify-receipt.mjs receipt.jsonl` (zero
 * dependencies). The header's `version` field carries the ISSUING product's
 * version (the SelfImpulse product line stamps here) — the
 * verifier treats the header as opaque, so both products verify identically.
